# [W3C Federated Learning CG](https://www.w3.org/community/federated-learning/)
The purpose of the group is to establish and explore the necessary standards related with the Web for federated learning via the analysis of current implementations related with federated learning such as TensorFlow Federated.

## Current implementations for federated learning
* [TensorFlow Federated(TFF)](https://github.com/tensorflow/federated): 
  * TFF is an open-source framework for machine learning and other computations on decentralized data
  * TFF has been developed to facilitate open research and experimentation with Federated Learning (FL), an approach to machine learning where a shared global model is trained across many participating clients that keep their training data locally
  * 

- ...

## Other related activities
* [ONNX.js](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxjs):
  * is a Javascript library for running ONNX models on browsers and on Node.js
  * has adopted WebAssembly and WebGL technologies for providing an optimized ONNX model inference runtime for both CPUs and GPUs
